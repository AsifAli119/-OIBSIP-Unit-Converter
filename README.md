## Project Description

The **Unit Converter** app is designed to facilitate easy conversion of values across various units of measurement. Whether it's converting lengths, weights, temperatures, or any other unit, this app has got you covered.

## Project Structure

The project codebase is organized into three main files:

1. **conversion_body.dart**: This file contains the UI implementation of the conversion screen. It displays input fields for the user to enter values and select units for conversion. The conversion results are displayed dynamically as the user interacts with the app.

2. **conversion_logic.dart**: The conversion logic is separated into this file. It contains functions responsible for performing actual unit conversions. By keeping the conversion logic separate, the code remains modular and easier to maintain.

3. **home_page.dart**: The home page file sets up the main app structure, including navigation and layout. It provides the structure for navigating between different conversion categories and displaying the appropriate conversion bodies.

## Installation
